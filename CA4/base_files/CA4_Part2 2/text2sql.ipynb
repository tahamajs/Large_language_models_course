    "\n",
    "#### **1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chain/Router model is a powerful architectural pattern used to create advanced, multi-skilled AI systems. Instead of relying on a single, monolithic model to handle all tasks, this architecture directs user requests to different, specialized processing workflows (\"Chains\") based on the nature of the request. The \"Router\" acts as an intelligent switchboard, ensuring that each query is handled by the most appropriate tool for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach leads to significantly higher accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, as it allows the system to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Core Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2.1. The \"Chain\": A Specialized Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Chain** is a sequence of pre-defined steps designed to accomplish a specific, narrow task. Each step's output serves as the input for the next. In the context of a Text-to-SQL application, you might have several distinct chains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple SQL Chain:** Optimized with a prompt that excels at generating basic, single-table queries.\n",
    "* **Complex SQL Chain:** Uses a more detailed prompt, perhaps with a few-shot learning examples, to handle multi-table `JOIN`s, subqueries, and complex aggregations.\n",
    "* **Data Analysis Chain:** A chain that not only generates SQL but also executes it and summarizes the results in natural language.\n",
    "* **Error Correction Chain:** A chain that takes a faulty SQL query and attempts to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating specialized chains, each can be fine-tuned and optimized for its unique purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2.2. The \"Router\": An Intelligent Decision-Maker**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Router** is the entry point of the system. Its sole responsibility is to analyze the incoming user request and decide which specialized Chain is best suited to handle it. The routing logic itself is typically powered by an LLM call with a prompt focused on classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Text-to-SQL system, the router would make the following kind of decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** User Question\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Router Analysis (LLM Call):**\n",
    "    * *Is this a simple question about one table?* ->  Route to **Simple SQL Chain**.\n",
    "    * *Does this question require joining multiple tables?* ->  Route to **Complex SQL Chain**.\n",
    "    * *Is the user asking to fix a previous query?* -> Route to **Error Correction Chain**.\n",
    "    * *Is this just a greeting or off-topic chat?* -> Route to a separate **General Conversation Chain**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Implementing a Chain/Router architecture provides several key advantages over a single-prompt approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved Accuracy:** By routing tasks to specialized chains with tailored prompts and logic, the system is far more likely to produce a correct result. A prompt for a complex query doesn't have to be generic enough to also handle a simple one.\n",
    "* **Increased Efficiency:** Simple requests can be routed to faster, less expensive models, while only complex requests utilize more powerful (and costly) models.\n",
    "* **Enhanced Robustness:** The system can gracefully handle a wide variety of inputs. It avoids trying to generate SQL from a non-SQL-related question (e.g., \"Hello, how are you?\"), which improves the user experience.\n",
    "* **Modularity and Maintainability:** Each chain can be developed, tested, and improved independently. This makes the overall system easier to manage and scale over time. You can add new capabilities simply by creating a new chain and teaching the router about it."

    "This Python script defines a query_generator_node function designed to convert a natural language question into a SQL query. It intelligently constructs a detailed prompt for an AI model (LLM) using the database schema and, if available, a pre-identified \"schema path\" to focus the AI's attention on the most relevant tables. The function is built to take this information and produce a clean SQL query as its final output.\n",

    "To verify this function works correctly without needing a live AI model for every test, the code includes a class called MockLLMSQLGenerator. It's important to understand that this mock class is a temporary placeholder used exclusively for testing purposes. Instead of using actual AI, it simply returns pre-written, hardcoded SQL queries based on keywords it finds in the test questions.\n",
