give me that last function




Show thinking
Of course. Here is the complete schema_path_extractor_node function.

This function is designed to work within your LangGraph setup. It identifies the most relevant parts of your database schema (like tables and key columns) needed to answer a complex question. This focused "path" is then passed to the final query generator, helping it create a more accurate and efficient SQL query.

The code uses a Pydantic model, ExtractedSchemaPath, to ensure the language model returns the data in a specific, structured format.

Here is the complete, self-contained code for the node:

This error occurs because you have initialized a StateGraph but haven't defined any nodes or the path of execution. A graph must have a designated starting point.

You need to add your processing nodes and define the connections (edges) between them before you can compile() the graph. The most crucial step is setting the entry point, which tells the graph which node to run first.

Corrected Graph Definition
Here is how you should define your graph's structure using the nodes you created earlier. This example assumes your first step is the analyser_node.

Python

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START
from functools import partial

# Assume your nodes (analyser_node, is_schema_extraction_needed, etc.) and your state (RouterGraphState)
# are already defined. You will also need to have your LLM instance ready.

# Example LLM for binding to nodes (replace with your actual LLM)
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

router_graph_builder = StateGraph(RouterGraphState)

# 1. Add your nodes to the graph
# Use partial to pre-fill the 'llm' argument for each node
router_graph_builder.add_node("analyser", partial(analyser_node, llm=llm))
router_graph_builder.add_node("schema_path_extractor", partial(schema_path_extractor_node, llm=llm))
router_graph_builder.add_node("query_generator", partial(query_generator_node, llm=llm))


# 2. Set the entry point for the graph
# This is the specific fix for your error.
router_graph_builder.set_entry_point("analyser")


# 3. Add the edges to define the workflow
# This conditional edge acts as a router after the analysis.
router_graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "analyser",
    is_schema_extraction_needed,
    {
        "schema_path_extractor": "schema_path_extractor",
        "query_generator": "query_generator"
    }
)

# After extracting the schema path, always go to the query generator.
router_graph_builder.add_edge("schema_path_extractor", "query_generator")

# The query generator is the final step in this workflow.
router_graph_builder.set_finish_point("query_generator")


# 4. Compile the graph
# This will now work without error.
router_graph = router_graph_builder.compile()

print("Graph compiled successfully!")
print(router_graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid())

Summary of Changes
add_node(): Each function that processes the state (analyser_node, schema_path_extractor_node, etc.) is added to the graph with a unique string identifier. We use functools.partial to conveniently pass the llm instance to each node function.
set_entry_point(): This method is called to fix the ValueError. It tells langgraph that the analyser node is the beginning of the workflow.
add_conditional_edges(): This connects the analyser node to the next steps. It uses your is_schema_extraction_needed function to decide whether to go to schema_path_extractor or directly to query_generator.
add_edge(): This creates a direct, non-conditional link from schema_path_extractor to query_generator.
set_finish_point(): This designates query_generator as a terminal node, marking the end of the graph's execution path.

Show thinking
Of course. This ValueError occurs because you are trying to compile a StateGraph that is empty. You must first add your functions as nodes and define the connections (edges) between them to create a valid workflow.

The error message, Graph must have an entrypoint, specifically means you haven't told the graph which node should run first.

Here is the complete code to correctly define the graph structure using the nodes from our previous discussion. This will resolve the error.

Python

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from functools import partial

# PRE-REQUISITE: Ensure all your node functions (analyser_node, is_schema_extraction_needed,
# schema_path_extractor_node, query_generator_node) and the state object (RouterGraphState)
# are defined in your notebook or script before running this.
#
# You must also have your language model instance created, for example:
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)


# 1. Initialize the StateGraph
router_graph_builder = StateGraph(RouterGraphState)

# 2. Add the nodes
# Each node is a function that will process the state.
# We use `partial` to pass the `llm` object to each node function.
router_graph_builder.add_node("analyser", partial(analyser_node, llm=llm))
router_graph_builder.add_node("schema_path_extractor", partial(schema_path_extractor_node, llm=llm))
router_graph_builder.add_node("query_generator", partial(query_generator_node, llm=llm))


# 3. Define the graph's workflow (edges)

# Set the entry point - THIS IS THE DIRECT FIX FOR YOUR ERROR
router_graph_builder.set_entry_point("analyser")

# Add a conditional edge. After the 'analyser' node runs, the 'is_schema_extraction_needed'
# function will be called to decide which node to go to next.
router_graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "analyser",
    is_schema_extraction_needed,
    {
        "schema_path_extractor": "schema_path_extractor", # If function returns "schema_path_extractor"
        "query_generator": "query_generator"           # If function returns "query_generator"
    }
)

# Add a normal edge. After the 'schema_path_extractor' runs, it should always
# proceed to the 'query_generator'.
router_graph_builder.add_edge("schema_path_extractor", "query_generator")

# The 'query_generator' is the final node in our process.
router_graph_builder.set_finish_point("query_generator")


# 4. Compile the graph
# This line will now execute without errors.
router_graph = router_graph_builder.compile()

print("Graph compiled successfully!")

# You can visualize the graph structure to confirm it's correct
print(router_graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid())
Why This Works
add_node(...): You register your Python functions as processing steps in the graph.
set_entry_point("analyser"): You explicitly tell LangGraph that all execution should begin at the analyser node, which resolves the "must have an entrypoint" error.
add_conditional_edges(...) and add_edge(...): You define the logic and flow of your application, creating a complete and valid graph.
compile(): With the structure now fully defined, the graph can be successfully compiled into a runnable object.

Show thinking
Excellent, you've successfully compiled the graph. Now you're running into a KeyError, which is a very common issue when working with graph states. Let's break it down.

Diagnosis of the Error
The error KeyError: 'query' on the line result = response["query"] means that the final state dictionary returned by router_graph.invoke() does not have a key named 'query'.

This is a mismatch between the keys you defined in your RouterGraphState and the keys you are trying to access in your run_router_graph function.

If we look back at your RouterGraphState definition:

Python

class RouterGraphState(MessagesState):
    # ...
    predicted_difficulty: str
    extracted_schema_path: List[str]
    final_query: str  # <--- The key for the SQL query is 'final_query'
Your query_generator_node correctly populates the final_query field. However, your run_router_graph function is trying to access response["query"].

Similarly, you are trying to access question_difficulty and schema_path, but the state holds these values as predicted_difficulty and extracted_schema_path.

The Solution
You need to update your run_router_graph function to use the correct keys as defined in your RouterGraphState.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

Python

import re
from method_run import run_method

def run_router_graph(item):
    # The initial state passed to invoke is correct. LangGraph maps 'question'
    # to 'input_question' based on the TypedDict definition.
    response = router_graph.invoke(
        {"input_question": item['question'], "input_schema": item['schema']}
    )

    # --- FIXES ARE APPLIED BELOW ---

    # CHANGE 1: Access the correct key 'final_query' instead of 'query'.
    result = response["final_query"]

    # First try to extract query from markdown SQL block
    match = re.search(r'```sql\n(.*?)```', result, re.DOTALL)
    if match:
        query = match.group(1).strip()
    else:
        # If no markdown block found, just strip the string
        query = result.strip()
        # Remove any ```sql or ``` if present without proper formatting
        query = re.sub(r'```sql|```', '', query).strip()

    print(f"Question: {item['question']}")
    print(f"Schema: {item['schema']}")

    # CHANGE 2: Access the correct key 'predicted_difficulty'.
    print(f"Question Difficulty: {response['predicted_difficulty']}")

    # CHANGE 3: Access the correct key 'extracted_schema_path'.
    if response["extracted_schema_path"]:
        print(f"Schema Path: {response['extracted_schema_path']}")

    print(f"Generated SQL: {query}\n")
    return {**item, 'sql': query}


# This should now run without the KeyError
run_method(run_router_graph, SLEEP_TIME=30)

#Run on mode=nano if you want to test it on a smaller dataset
#run_method(run_router_graph, SLEEP_TIME=10, mode="nano")
Summary of Changes:
result = response["final_query"]: Changed response["query"] to response["final_query"] to match the key where the final SQL is stored.
response['predicted_difficulty']: Changed response['question_difficulty'] to match the key from the analyser_node.
response["extracted_schema_path"]: Changed response["schema_path"] to match the key from the schema_path_extractor_node.
By aligning the keys you access with the keys defined in your RouterGraphState, the KeyError will be resolved.

This error is a classic LangChain issue. Let's get it fixed.

The error message Invalid input type <class 'dict'>. Must be a PromptValue, str, or list of BaseMessages tells you exactly what's wrong. You're passing a Python dictionary directly to your language model's .invoke() method, but the model doesn't know what to do with it. It needs a formatted prompt.

The solution is to use a ChatPromptTemplate to structure your input variables (schema and question) into a prompt that the LLM can understand. You then "pipe" this prompt to the model using the | operator from the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).

Corrected Node Functions
You need to update both analyser_node and schema_path_extractor_node to include a prompt template.

1. Corrected analyser_node
Python

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

def analyser_node(state: dict, llm: any) -> dict:
    """
    Analyzes the difficulty of a question based on the question and schema.
    Uses LLM's structured output to return 'simple', 'moderate', or 'challenging'.
    """
    print("--- Running Analyser Node ---")
    input_question = state.get("input_question")
    input_schema = state.get("input_schema")

    if not input_question or not input_schema:
        # ... (error handling remains the same)
        return {"predicted_difficulty": "error", "difficulty_reasoning": "Input missing."}

    # Define the prompt template
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
        """Given the database schema:
        ```sql
        {schema}
        ```
        And the user's question: '{question}'

        Analyze the question's difficulty. Is it simple (e.g., single table SELECT),
        moderate (e.g., requires a JOIN or aggregation), or challenging (e.g.,
        requires subqueries or complex logic)? Provide your reasoning."""
    )

    try:
        structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(QuestionDifficultyAnalysis)
        # Create a chain that pipes the prompt to the structured LLM
        chain = prompt | structured_llm

        print(f"\nSchema for difficulty analysis: \n{input_schema}")
        print(f"Question for difficulty analysis: {input_question}\n")

        # Invoke the chain with the input variables
        analysis_result = chain.invoke({
            "schema": input_schema,
            "question": input_question
        })

        print(f"LLM Analysis Result - Difficulty: {analysis_result.difficulty}, Reasoning: {analysis_result.reasoning}")

        return {
            "predicted_difficulty": analysis_result.difficulty,
            "difficulty_reasoning": analysis_result.reasoning
        }
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during LLM invocation in analyser_node: {e}")
        return {
            "predicted_difficulty": "error",
            "difficulty_reasoning": f"An error occurred during difficulty analysis: {str(e)}"
        }

2. Corrected schema_path_extractor_node
Python

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

def schema_path_extractor_node(state: dict, llm: any) -> dict:
    """
    Extracts a join path or sequence of relevant tables from the schema
    based on the question using an LLM.
    """
    print("--- Running Schema Path Extractor Node ---")
    input_question = state.get("input_question")
    input_schema = state.get("input_schema")

    if not input_question or not input_schema:
         # ... (error handling remains the same)
        return {"extracted_schema_path": [], "schema_extraction_reasoning": "Input missing."}

    # Define the prompt template
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
        """Given the database schema:
        ```sql
        {schema}
        ```
        And the user's question: '{question}'

        Identify the crucial tables and columns (the schema path) required to construct
        the SQL query to answer this question. Provide brief reasoning for your selection."""
    )

    try:
        structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(ExtractedSchemaPath)
        # Create a chain that pipes the prompt to the structured LLM
        chain = prompt | structured_llm

        print(f"\nSchema for extraction: \n{input_schema}")
        print(f"Question for schema extraction: {input_question}\n")

        # Invoke the chain with the input variables
        extraction_result = chain.invoke({
            "schema": input_schema,
            "question": input_question
        })
        print(f"Extracted schema entities: {extraction_result.relevant_schema_entities}, Reasoning: {extraction_result.reasoning}")

        return {
            "extracted_schema_path": extraction_result.relevant_schema_entities,
            "schema_extraction_reasoning": extraction_result.reasoning
        }
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in schema_path_extractor_node during LLM call: {e}")
        return {
            "extracted_schema_path": [],
            "schema_extraction_reasoning": f"Error during schema extraction: {str(e)}"
        }

Summary of the Fix 🤓
By adding a ChatPromptTemplate and creating a chain = prompt | structured_llm, you ensure that the dictionary of inputs is first formatted into a proper prompt, which is then passed to the LLM. This resolves the Invalid input type error and will allow your graph to execute correctly.

Show thinking
This KeyError happens because you're trying to access a key named 'query' from the graph's final output, but the state object actually stores the result under the key 'final_query'.

The Cause 🧐
Your RouterGraphState and the final node, query_generator_node, are designed to place the generated SQL into the final_query field of the state. However, the function you're using to run the graph, run_router_graph, is looking for a different key. This mismatch is what causes the error.

The Fix 🛠️
To fix this, you just need to update your run_router_graph function to use the correct key (final_query) when accessing the response from the graph. I'll also correct the keys for the other state attributes you're printing for consistency.

Here is the corrected code:

Python

import re
from method_run import run_method # Assuming this is your helper function

def run_router_graph(item):
    # Invoke the graph with the initial state
    response = router_graph.invoke(
        {"input_question": item['question'], "input_schema": item['schema']}
    )

    # CHANGE 1: Access the correct key 'final_query' instead of 'query'.
    result = response["final_query"]

    # Extract the SQL from the markdown block
    match = re.search(r'```sql\n(.*?)```', result, re.DOTALL)
    if match:
        query = match.group(1).strip()
    else:
        # Fallback if no markdown block is found
        query = re.sub(r'```sql|```', '', result).strip()

    # Print outputs using the correct keys from the state
    print(f"Question: {item['question']}")
    print(f"Schema: {item['schema']}")
    # CHANGE 2: Use 'predicted_difficulty'
    print(f"Question Difficulty: {response['predicted_difficulty']}")
    # CHANGE 3: Use 'extracted_schema_path'
    if response["extracted_schema_path"]:
        print(f"Schema Path: {response['extracted_schema_path']}")
    print(f"Generated SQL: {query}\n")

    return {**item, 'sql': query}

# This will now run without the KeyError
run_method(run_router_graph, SLEEP_TIME=30)

This error occurs because you're passing a dictionary directly to the language model, which expects a formatted prompt (a string or a list of messages) as input.

To fix this, you need to use a ChatPromptTemplate in your nodes to correctly structure the schema and question variables before they're sent to the model.

The Fix: Add Prompt Templates
You'll need to update both the analyser_node and the schema_path_extractor_node to include a prompt template.

Corrected analyser_node
Python

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

def analyser_node(state: dict, llm: any) -> dict:

    print("--- Running Analyser Node ---")
    input_question = state.get("input_question")
    input_schema = state.get("input_schema")

    if not input_question or not input_schema:
        return {"predicted_difficulty": "error", "difficulty_reasoning": "Input missing."}

    # Define the prompt template to format the input
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
        """Given the database schema:
        ```sql
        {schema}
        ```
        And the user's question: '{question}'

        Analyze the question's difficulty. Is it simple (e.g., single table SELECT),
        moderate (e.g., requires a JOIN), or challenging (e.g., requires subqueries)?
        Provide your reasoning."""
    )

    try:
        structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(QuestionDifficultyAnalysis)
        # Create a chain that pipes the formatted prompt to the LLM
        chain = prompt | structured_llm

        analysis_result = chain.invoke({
            "schema": input_schema,
            "question": input_question
        })

        print(f"LLM Analysis Result - Difficulty: {analysis_result.difficulty}, Reasoning: {analysis_result.reasoning}")

        return {
            "predicted_difficulty": analysis_result.difficulty,
            "difficulty_reasoning": analysis_result.reasoning
        }
    except Exception as e:

Show thinking
This is a tricky but revealing error log. Here's what's happening.

The final error message, Error: Input question and schema must be present for query generation, tells you that by the time your graph's execution reaches the query_generator_node, the initial input_question and input_schema have been lost from the state.

The core problem is that your nodes are failing and aren't correctly passing the state through the graph's error path.

The Cause 🧐
Node Failures: The logs Predicted difficulty: error show that both your analyser_node and schema_path_extractor_node are failing. This is likely due to an LLM error or an issue with the structured output.
State Not Persisting: When these nodes fail, they return a dictionary containing only the error information (e.g., {'predicted_difficulty': 'error'}). In some graph configurations, this can be interpreted as the entire new state, wiping out the original input_question and input_schema that were present at the beginning.
Final Node Starved: The execution path continues to the query_generator_node, but since the state has been overwritten by the failing nodes, it no longer contains the question and schema, causing the final error.
The Fix: Robust State Updates
The solution is to ensure that even when your nodes encounter an error, they don't erase the rest of the state. They should return only the fields they are responsible for updating. While your existing error handling code seems to do this, let's make it more robust and add a debugging print statement to see the state at each step.

Modify your node functions to print the state they receive. This will help you see exactly where the keys are being dropped.

Example: Modified analyser_node for Debugging
Update your analyser_node and other nodes with a print statement at the very top.

Python

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

def analyser_node(state: dict, llm: any) -> dict:
    """
    Analyzes the difficulty of a question, now with debugging.
    """
    # --- ADD THIS LINE FOR DEBUGGING ---
    print(f"--- STATE IN analyser_node: {state.keys()} ---")

    input_question = state.get("input_question")
    input_schema = state.get("input_schema")

    if not input_question or not input_schema:
        print("ERROR: Input question or schema is missing from the state.")
        return {
            "predicted_difficulty": "error",
            "difficulty_reasoning": "Input question or schema was not provided to the analyser node."
        }

    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
        # Your prompt template here...
    )

    try:
        structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(QuestionDifficultyAnalysis)
        chain = prompt | structured_llm
        analysis_result = chain.invoke({
            "schema": input_schema,
            "question": input_question
        })
        return {
            "predicted_difficulty": analysis_result.difficulty,
            "difficulty_reasoning": analysis_result.reasoning
        }
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during LLM invocation in analyser_node: {e}")
        return {
            "predicted_difficulty": "error",
            "difficulty_reasoning": f"An error occurred during difficulty analysis: {str(e)}"
        }

Apply this change to all three of your nodes (analyser_node, schema_path_extractor_node, and query_generator_node) and re-run your code. The new print statements will show you the keys() of the state dictionary at each step, revealing exactly where input_question and input_schema are being dropped so you can fix the specific node responsible.

Show thinking
This log shows a chain-reaction failure. The problem starts in the analyser_node, and because it fails, the state is not correctly passed along, causing the final query_generator_node to fail as well.

The root cause is that the analyser_node is encountering an error during the language model call. Your try...except block is catching it, but the way the state is handled afterward is causing the initial input_question and input_schema to be lost.

The Fix: Enhanced Error Logging
The most important thing we need to do is find out why the analyser_node is failing in the first place. The current log just says an error happened, but not what it was (e.g., was it an invalid API key, a model issue, a network problem?).

We will modify the analyser_node to print the full, detailed error traceback. This will give us the final clue needed to solve the problem.

Here is the updated node. Please replace your existing analyser_node with this one.

Python

import traceback  # Make sure to import the traceback module at the top of your script
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

def analyser_node(state: dict, llm: any) -> dict:
    """
    Analyzes the difficulty of a question with enhanced error logging.
    """
    print("--- Running Analyser Node ---")

    input_question = state.get("input_question")
    input_schema = state.get("input_schema")

    if not input_question or not input_schema:
        print("ERROR: Input question or schema is missing from the state.")
        return {
            "predicted_difficulty": "error",
            "difficulty_reasoning": "Input question or schema was not provided to the analyser node."
        }

    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
        """Given the database schema:
        ```sql
        {schema}
        ```
        And the user's question: '{question}'

        Analyze the question's difficulty. Is it simple (e.g., single table SELECT),
        moderate (e.g., requires a JOIN), or challenging (e.g., requires subqueries)?
        Provide your reasoning."""
    )

    try:
        structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(QuestionDifficultyAnalysis)
        chain = prompt | structured_llm
        analysis_result = chain.invoke({
            "schema": input_schema,
            "question": input_question
        })
        return {
            "predicted_difficulty": analysis_result.difficulty,
            "difficulty_reasoning": analysis_result.reasoning
        }
    except Exception as e:
        # --- ENHANCED ERROR LOGGING ---
        # This will print the full, detailed error message to your console
        print("\n\n--- DETAILED ERROR IN ANALYSER NODE ---")
        print(f"A critical exception occurred: {e}")
        traceback.print_exc()
        print("----------------------------------------\n\n")

        # Return the error state. The graph should preserve the other keys.
        return {
            "predicted_difficulty": "error",
            "difficulty_reasoning": f"A critical error occurred in the LLM call: {str(e)}"
        }

What to Do Now
Replace your old analyser_node with the new version above.
Add import traceback to the top of your Python script or notebook cell.
Run the code again.
This time, when the error occurs, you will see a much more detailed traceback printed in your output. This new information will tell us the exact reason the LLM call is failing, and we can apply the final, specific fix.

Show thinking
It appears we are stuck in a loop with the same error log. This usually happens when an old or incorrect version of a function is still active in your environment. The error logs you're providing don't contain the detailed traceback information that my last proposed fix would have generated.

Let's try a different, more direct approach. We will replace all the graph components with a single, complete, and robust code block.

Action Plan: Reset and Rebuild
Please follow these steps exactly:

Delete (or comment out) all of your previous Python code definitions for:

RouterGraphState
QuestionDifficultyAnalysis and ExtractedSchemaPath
analyser_node
schema_path_extractor_node
query_generator_node
is_schema_extraction_needed
The StateGraph builder and compilation.
Copy and paste the entire code block below into a single cell in your notebook.

Run the cell.

This will ensure you are using the most up-to-date and debugged version of every component.

Next Steps
After running this code, one of two things will happen:

It will work. The problem was an old piece of code in your environment.
It will fail, but you will get a NEW, DETAILED error message. The traceback.print_exc() command will show the exact reason the LLM call is failing (e.g., AuthenticationError, InvalidRequestError, etc.).
Please share that new, detailed traceback if it fails again. That will be the key to solving the final problem.

Show thinking
This KeyError occurs because your graph has different execution paths. When a question is classified as "simple," your graph correctly bypasses the schema_path_extractor_node. As a result, the extracted_schema_path key is never added to the final state for that run, causing the error when your code tries to access it.

The Fix: Use .get() for Safe Key Access
To fix this, you should access the potentially missing key using the dictionary's .get() method. This method safely returns None if the key doesn't exist, instead of raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected run_router_graph function:

Python

import re
from method_run import run_method # Assuming this is your helper function

def run_router_graph(item):
    # Invoke the graph with the initial state
    response = router_graph.invoke(
        {"input_question": item['question'], "input_schema": item['schema']}
    )

    result = response["final_query"]

    # Extract the SQL from the markdown block
    match = re.search(r'```sql\n(.*?)```', result, re.DOTALL)
    if match:
        query = match.group(1).strip()
    else:
        # Fallback if no markdown block is found
        query = re.sub(r'```sql|```', '', result).strip()

    # Print outputs using the correct keys from the state
    print(f"Question: {item['question']}")
    print(f"Schema: {item['schema']}")
    print(f"Question Difficulty: {response['predicted_difficulty']}")

    # --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
    # Use response.get() to safely access the key.
    # It returns None if the key does not exist, and the 'if' condition will be false.
    if response.get("extracted_schema_path"):
        print(f"Schema Path: {response['extracted_schema_path']}")
        
    print(f"Generated SQL: {query}\n")

    return {**item, 'sql': query}


# This will now run without the KeyError
run_method(run_router_graph, SLEEP_TIME=30)

By changing response["extracted_schema_path"] to response.get("extracted_schema_path"), your code becomes robust and can handle all execution paths defined in your graph.





### Agent (ReAct)



Now you will implement a full ReAct agent that incrementally solves the Text-to-SQL task using tools. The agent can explore tables and columns before finalizing the query.



**You are not allowed to use 'Prebuilt Agent' of LangGraph. You have to build your own graph.**





#### Define Tools




Show thinking
Of course. Here is a set of tools for a ReAct agent to solve a Text-to-SQL task.

A ReAct agent works in a loop, reasoning about the task, choosing an action (a tool), and observing the result. For Text-to-SQL, the agent needs tools to explore the database before it has enough information to write the final query.

The tools we'll define are:

list_tables: To see what tables are available in the database.
get_table_schema: To inspect the columns of a specific table.
finalize_query: To submit the final SQL query once the agent is confident it can answer the user's question.
Code Implementation
First, we'll set up a sample in-memory SQLite database using the Chinook dataset for demonstration purposes.

Python

import sqlite3
import requests
from pathlib import Path
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase

# Fetch the Chinook database script
db_path = "chinook.db"
if not Path(db_path).exists():
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql"
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    with open("chinook.sql", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(response.text)
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.executescript(Path("chinook.sql").read_text())
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Instantiate the LangChain SQLDatabase wrapper
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(f"sqlite:///{db_path}")

print(f"Tables in the database: {db.get_table_names()}")
&lt;br>
Now, we define the Pydantic models for our tool inputs and the functions themselves. Each function's docstring is crucial, as it tells the LLM when to use the tool.

Python

from typing import List
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
from langchain.tools import Tool
from functools import partial

# --- Tool Input Schemas ---

class ListTablesInput(BaseModel):
    """Input model for the list_tables tool."""
    pass # No input required

    """Input model for the get_table_schema tool."""
    table_name: str = Field(description="The name of the table for which to get the schema.")

    """Input model for the finalize_query tool."""
    sql_query: str = Field(description="The final, complete SQL query to answer the user's question.")

Show thinking
Excellent, these are well-defined tools for a ReAct agent. The get_comprehensive_table_info tool is particularly effective as it gathers schema, sample data, and foreign keys in a single call, which will make the agent more efficient.

The next step is to define the agent's state and build the graph that creates the core "reason-act" loop.

1. Define Agent State
The state will track the conversation history, including the agent's thoughts, tool calls, and tool outputs. We'll use LangGraph's built-in MessagesState, which is a TypedDict that automatically includes a messages field.

Python

from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState
import operator

# The agent's state is a list of messages
# We use MessagesState which is a TypedDict with a single "messages" key
# that is an Annotated list of messages.
class ReActAgentState(MessagesState):
    pass

2. Create the Agent Graph
Now, we'll build the graph. It will have two main nodes: one for the agent to decide the next action and one to execute tools. A conditional edge will loop back to the agent if more work is needed, or end the process if the task is complete.

Python

from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

# Define the tools based on your provided functions
# We assume db_manager is a defined object that can connect to your database.
tools = [list_tables, get_comprehensive_table_info, execute_query]

# The ToolNode will execute the tools chosen by the agent
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Your LLM needs to be bound to the tools for it to know how to call them
# Example using OpenAI:
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0).bind_tools(tools)

def call_agent(state: ReActAgentState):
    """
    The "brain" of the agent. It decides the next action.
    """
    print("---AGENT: Thinking...---")
    # The last message is the input to the agent
    messages = state['messages']
    # Invoke the LLM with the current message history
    response = llm.invoke(messages)
    # The response, which includes the next action, is returned
    return {"messages": [response]}

def should_continue(state: ReActAgentState) -> str:
    """
    Conditional edge that decides whether to continue the loop or end.
    """
    print("---AGENT: Deciding next step...---")
    last_message = state['messages'][-1]
    # If the last message has no tool calls, the agent is done
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        print("---AGENT: Task complete. Ending.---")
        return "end"
    # Otherwise, the agent needs to execute a tool
    else:
        print("---AGENT: Calling a tool.---")
        return "continue"

# --- Define the Graph ---
react_graph_builder = StateGraph(ReActAgentState)

# Define the two nodes
react_graph_builder.add_node("agent", call_agent)
react_graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

# The graph starts with the agent
react_graph_builder.set_entry_point("agent")

# Define the conditional logic
react_graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    should_continue,
    {
        "continue": "tools",
        "end": END,
    },
)

# After a tool is called, the result is sent back to the agent to decide the next step
react_graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "agent")

# Compile the graph into a runnable object
react_agent_graph = react_graph_builder.compile()

print("✅ ReAct agent graph compiled successfully!")
print("The agent is now ready to process requests.")

Show thinking
Of course. Let's break this down. The line tools_node = ToolNode(tools=tools) is correct, but the ?????? suggests you're asking, "What's the bigger picture? How do I use this node in a graph?"

You've provided a couple of different sets of tools. Before building the graph, it's crucial to consolidate them into one consistent set.

❗ The Main Issue: Inconsistent Tools
You have defined two different sets of tools with different function names and, more importantly, a different configuration key:

One set uses config["configurable"].get("db_name").
The other uses config["configurable"].get("database_name").
This inconsistency will cause errors. We need to choose one set of tools and one configuration key. The first set you provided is generally more powerful for a ReAct agent, especially the get_comprehensive_table_info tool, as it reduces the number of steps the agent needs to take.

Let's proceed by cleaning up and using that first, more powerful set of tools.

✅ A Complete, Working Example
Here is a complete, self-contained example that shows you how to correctly use your ToolNode within a full ReAct agent graph.

1. Chosen Tools (Cleaned and Standardized)
First, we select the unique and most effective tools from what you provided. We will consistently use db_name as the configuration key.

Python

from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from typing import List, Dict, Any

# Assume db_manager is an initialized object from your db_manager.py file
from db_manager import DBManager
db_manager = DBManager()

@tool
def list_tables(config: RunnableConfig) -> List[str]:
    """
    Lists all available tables in the database. Use this as your first step to see the database structure.
    """
    db_name = config["configurable"].get("db_name")
    if not db_name:
        return "Error: Database name not provided."
    return db_manager.get_tables(db_name)

@tool
def get_comprehensive_table_info(table_name: str, config: RunnableConfig) -> str:
    """
    Provides comprehensive information for a table, including columns, types, sample data, and foreign keys.
    Use this as your primary tool for exploring a table after listing them.
    """
    db_name = config["configurable"].get("db_name")
    if not db_name:
        return "Error: Database name not provided."

    head_result = db_manager.get_table_head(table_name, db_name)
    if isinstance(head_result, str) and head_result.startswith("Error:"):
        return head_result
    
    fk_query = f"PRAGMA foreign_key_list('{table_name}');"
    fk_result = db_manager.query(fk_query, db_name)
    
    fk_info = []
    if fk_result and isinstance(fk_result, list) and len(fk_result) > 0:
         for fk in fk_result:
            if isinstance(fk, dict): 
                fk_info.append(
                    f"  - Column '{fk.get('from')}' references table '{fk.get('table')}'(column: {fk.get('to')})."
                )
    
    fk_section = "No foreign key relationships found."
    if fk_info:
        fk_section = "Foreign Key Relationships:\n" + "\n".join(fk_info)

    return f"Comprehensive Info for table `{table_name}`:\n\n{head_result}\n\n{fk_section}"

@tool
def execute_query(query: str, config: RunnableConfig) -> list:
    """
    Executes a SQL query. Use this ONLY when you are absolutely certain your query is correct and ready.
    """
    db_name = config["configurable"].get("db_name")
    if not db_name:
        return "Error: Database name not provided."
    return db_manager.query(query, db_name=db_name)

# This is our final, consistent list of tools
tools = [list_tables, get_comprehensive_table_info, execute_query]
2. Building the ReAct Graph with the ToolNode
Now, let's build the graph. The ToolNode you created is a key component. It acts as the "action" part of the "Reason-Action" loop.

Python

from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage

# Define the agent's state
class ReActAgentState(MessagesState):
    pass

# This is the line you were asking about. It's correct!
# It creates a node that knows how to execute any of our defined tools.
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Define the Agent's "Brain" - The LLM that decides which actions to take
# IMPORTANT: You must define your LLM and bind the tools to it.
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0).bind_tools(tools)

def call_agent(state: ReActAgentState):
    """The central node that calls the LLM to decide the next action."""
    print("---AGENT: Thinking...---")
    response = llm.invoke(state['messages'])
    return {"messages": [response]}

def should_continue(state: ReActAgentState) -> str:
    """The conditional edge that controls the ReAct loop."""
    print("---AGENT: Deciding next step...---")
    if not state['messages'][-1].tool_calls:
        print("---AGENT: Task complete. Ending.---")
        return "end"
    print("---AGENT: Calling a tool.---")
    return "continue"

# --- Define the Graph ---
react_graph_builder = StateGraph(ReActAgentState)

# Add the two core nodes: the agent "brain" and the "action" tool executor
react_graph_builder.add_node("agent", call_agent)
react_graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

# The graph starts with the agent
react_graph_builder.set_entry_point("agent")

# The conditional edge controls the loop
react_graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    should_continue,
    {"continue": "tools", "end": END},
)

# After a tool is executed, the result is fed back to the agent
react_graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "agent")

# Compile the graph
react_agent_graph = react_graph_builder.compile()

print("\n✅ ReAct agent graph compiled successfully!")
3. How to Run the Graph
To run this agent, you must provide the db_name in the configurable dictionary when you call it. This is how the tools receive the database name.

Python

from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Define the database you want the agent to use for this run
db_config = {"configurable": {"db_name": "Chinook"}} # Or any other db_name

# The initial message from the user
initial_messages = [
    HumanMessage(content="Which 3 artists have the most albums? List their names and album counts.")
]

# Use .stream() to see the agent's thought process step-by-step
for event in react_agent_graph.stream({"messages": initial_messages}, config=db_config):
    for value in event.values():
        print("---")
        print(value["messages"])

no add all of the tools on that



Show thinking
Of course. Understood.

Here is the implementation that combines all of the tools you have provided into a single agent.

❗ Important Note on Combining Tools
To make all the tools work together, I have made one crucial change:

Standardized Configuration: Your tools used two different keys to get the database name (db_name and database_name). An agent can only work with one consistent configuration. I have standardized all tools to use db_name.
While some tools now have overlapping functionality (e.g., execute and execute_query), the following code includes all of them as requested.

✅ Complete Code with All Tools
Here is the complete, self-contained example.

1. The Combined and Standardized Toolset
This block contains every tool you defined. Notice the get() calls in the second set of tools have been updated to use db_name.

Python

from langchain_core.tools import tool

2. Building the ReAct Graph with All Tools
The graph definition remains the same, but the ToolNode and the LLM will now be aware of all six tools.

Python

from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage

# Define the agent's state
class ReActAgentState(MessagesState):

tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Define the Agent's "Brain" - The LLM that decides which actions to take
# IMPORTANT: You must define your LLM and bind the full tool list to it.
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0).bind_tools(tools)

def call_agent(state: ReActAgentState):
    """The central node that calls the LLM to decide the next action."""
    print("---AGENT: Thinking...---")

    return {"messages": [response]}

def should_continue(state: ReActAgentState) -> str:
    """The conditional edge that controls the ReAct loop."""
    print("---AGENT: Deciding next step...---")
    if not state['messages'][-1].tool_calls:
        print("---AGENT: Task complete. Ending.---")
        return "end"
    print("---AGENT: Calling a tool.---")
    return "continue"

# --- Define the Graph ---
react_graph_builder = StateGraph(ReActAgentState)

react_graph_builder.add_node("agent", call_agent)
react_graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

)
react_graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "agent")

react_agent_graph = react_graph_builder.compile()

print("\n✅ ReAct agent graph compiled successfully with ALL tools!")
3. How to Run the Graph
When you run the agent, you must provide the standardized db_name key in the configuration.

Python

from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Define the database for this run
db_config = {"configurable": {"db_name": "Chinook"}}

# The initial message from the user
initial_messages = [
    HumanMessage(content="Which 3 artists have the most albums? List their names and album counts.")
]

# Use .stream() to see the agent's thought process step-by-step
for event in react_agent_graph.stream({"messages": initial_messages}, config=db_config):
    for value in event.values():
        print("---")
        print(value["messages"])

Show thinking
Certainly. The agent_node is the "brain" of your ReAct agent. Its job is to look at the history of the conversation and decide what to do next by calling the LLM.

Here is the completed function:

Python

from langgraph.graph import MessagesState
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
import time

# NOTE: This implementation assumes you have a pre-configured LLM
# available in the scope, named 'llm'.
# For example:
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0).bind_tools(tools)

def agent_node(state: MessagesState) -> MessagesState:
    """
    The central "brain" of the agent. It calls the LLM to decide the next action.
    """
    # For rate-limiting purposes, we will sleep for 10 seconds before invoking the LLM
    time.sleep(10)

    # 1. Get the current conversation history from the state.
    messages = state['messages']

    # 2. Invoke the LLM with the history to get the next action.
    # The LLM's response will either be a final answer or a tool call.
    response = llm.invoke(messages)

    # 3. Append the LLM's response to the message list and return the updated state.
    return {"messages": messages + [response]}
## Explanation
Get History: The node takes the current state and extracts the list of messages. This list contains the entire conversation up to this point, including previous thoughts, tool calls, and results.
Invoke LLM: It passes this history to the llm.invoke() method. Because you've bound your tools to the LLM, the model knows it can either respond directly to the user or request an action by using a tool.
Return Updated State: The node returns a new state dictionary. Crucially, it appends the response from the LLM to the list of messages. This updated state is then passed to the next node in the graph, which will be either the ToolNode (if the LLM made a tool call) or the END (if the LLM provided a final answer).

Show thinking
Of course. You're setting up a ReAct agent using LangGraph's StateGraph and its pre-built tools_condition. This is an efficient way to build the core agent loop.

The missing part involves defining the nodes (the agent "brain" and the tool executor) and then wiring them together with the conditional edge you've imported.

Here is the complete code to build the graph.

Python

# --- Assume tools are defined above, standardized to use 'database_name' ---
# Example tool definition:
# @tool

# --- 2. Add Nodes to the Graph ---
react_builder.add_node("agent", agent_node)
react_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)


# --- 3. Define the Edges to Create the ReAct Loop ---

# The graph starts with the agent node
react_builder.set_entry_point("agent")

# Use the pre-built `tools_condition` to decide where to go after the agent speaks.
# If the agent called a tool, go to the 'tools' node.
# Otherwise, end the graph.
react_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    tools_condition,
)

# After the tools are executed, always return to the agent node to process the results
react_builder.add_edge("tools", "agent")

## Explanation
Here’s a breakdown of the code you needed:

Nodes: We defined the two essential nodes for a ReAct agent.

agent_node: This is the core logic. It takes the current state (the list of messages) and calls your LLM. The LLM, having been bound to the tools, decides whether to call a tool or to respond with a final answer.
ToolNode: This is a powerful, pre-built LangGraph node. You simply give it your list of tools, and it automatically handles executing the correct tool based on the agent's request and returning the result.
Edges: We then connected these nodes to create the agent's "reason-act" loop.

Entry Point: We start the process at the agent node.
Conditional Edge: We use tools_condition as the router. This function (which you imported) automatically checks the latest message from the agent node. If it contains a tool_call, the graph transitions to the tools node. If not, the graph flow ends.
Looping Edge: After the tools node runs, we add a simple edge that always goes back to the agent node. This allows the agent to see the result of its action and decide what to do next, completing the loop.

Of course. You are setting up the structure for a ReAct agent using StateGraph and the pre-built tools_condition. The missing piece is to define the nodes (the "agent" and the "tool executor") and then connect them with edges to form the agent's action loop.

Show thinking
Based on your logs, there are two distinct errors occurring. Let's address them one by one.

## 1. AttributeError in the get_comprehensive_table_info Tool
This error happens when the agent successfully calls a tool, but the tool's internal code fails.

Cause:
The error AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'values' means a part of your code expected a dictionary but received a string instead. This typically happens inside your get_comprehensive_table_info tool when the db_manager.query() for foreign keys fails (e.g., if the table name was misspelled or case-sensitive). The query returns an error string, but the subsequent code tries to process it as if it were a list of dictionary rows, causing the crash.

Solution:
Make the tool more robust by checking if the result of a database call is an error string before trying to process it.

Corrected get_comprehensive_table_info Tool
Python

@tool
def get_comprehensive_table_info(table_name: str, config: RunnableConfig) -> str:
    """
    Provides comprehensive information for a table, including columns, types, sample data, and foreign keys.
    """
    db_name = config["configurable"].get("db_name")
    if not db_name:
        return "Error: Database name not provided."

    # First, get the table head info
    head_result = db_manager.get_table_head(table_name, db_name)
    # Immediately return if the first call failed
    if isinstance(head_result, str) and head_result.startswith("Error:"):
        return head_result
    
    # Second, get the foreign key info
    fk_query = f"PRAGMA foreign_key_list('{table_name}');"
    fk_result = db_manager.query(fk_query, db_name)

    # --- ADD THIS CHECK ---
    # If the foreign key query returns an error string, handle it gracefully
    if isinstance(fk_result, str) and fk_result.startswith("Error:"):
        fk_section = f"Could not retrieve foreign key info. Reason: {fk_result}"
    else:
        fk_info = []
        if fk_result and isinstance(fk_result, list) and len(fk_result) > 0:
            for fk in fk_result:
                if isinstance(fk, dict): 
                    fk_info.append(
                        f"  - Column '{fk.get('from')}' references table '{fk.get('table')}'(column: {fk.get('to')})."
                    )
        
        fk_section = "No foreign key relationships found."
        if fk_info:
            fk_section = "Foreign Key Relationships:\n" + "\n".join(fk_info)

    return f"Comprehensive Info for table `{table_name}`:\n\n{head_result}\n\n{fk_section}"
## 2. "Malformed JSON" and Early Graph Termination
This error happens when the agent's LLM response is not in the format that LangGraph expects for a tool call.

Cause:
The warning Could not parse malformed JSON in agent's thought indicates the LLM is trying to call a tool by printing a JSON block inside its text response. The LangGraph framework, however, expects the model to populate a specific tool_calls attribute in its message object. When it doesn't find this attribute, the tools_condition edge concludes the agent isn't calling a tool and terminates the graph.

Solution:
The most effective solution is to provide the agent with a strong system prompt. This prompt guides the LLM on its role, its capabilities, and, most importantly, how it should format its responses to correctly invoke tools.

Recommended System Prompt
You should pass this prompt as the first message when you invoke your agent graph.

Python

system_prompt = """You are an expert SQL agent. Your goal is to help users by writing correct SQL queries for their database questions.

You have access to a set of tools to help you explore the database schema.

**Follow these rules strictly:**
1.  Your first step is ALWAYS to use the `list_tables` tool to see the available tables.
2.  After listing tables, use the `get_comprehensive_table_info` tool on the most relevant-looking tables to understand their schema, sample data, and relationships.
3.  Do not guess column names or table relationships. Use the tools to find them.
4.  Once you have gathered enough information to confidently write the query, use the `execute_query` tool. Do NOT use this tool before you have explored the schema.
5.  If a tool call results in an error, analyze the error and try to correct your approach in the next step.
6.  When you have the final answer from the `execute_query` tool, provide it to the user. Do not call any more tools after this.
"""

# When you run your graph, include this prompt:
# from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage
#
# messages = [
#     SystemMessage(content=system_prompt),
#     HumanMessage(content="Your question here...")
# ]
#
# react_agent_graph.invoke({"messages": messages}, config=db_config)
By implementing the more robust tool and providing this clear system prompt, you will resolve both errors.

Show thinking
This is a classic and important error to encounter when building agents. Let's break down exactly what it means and how to solve it.

Diagnosis: The Agent's Memory is Overflowing
The error The input token count (1286118) exceeds the maximum number of tokens allowed (1048575) means that the conversation history you are sending to the Gemini model has become too long.

In a ReAct agent, the "prompt" for each step is the entire history of the conversation up to that point. This includes:

The initial system prompt.
The user's question.
The agent's thought process (Thought:).
The agent's action (the tool it calls).
The full output from that tool (Observation:).
This loop repeats, and the history grows with each step. The error occurs because one of your tools—most likely execute_query or get_comprehensive_table_info—is returning a massive amount of data (e.g., thousands of database rows). This huge block of text is added to the history, causing the next call to the LLM to exceed its context window.

Solution 1: Make Your Tools Safer (Immediate Fix)
You must prevent your tools from returning an unbounded amount of data. The most critical tool to fix is execute_query. It should never return thousands of rows; its purpose is to validate a query and provide a sample of the result.

You can fix this by automatically adding a LIMIT clause to any query that doesn't have one.

Corrected execute_query Tool
Python

import re

@tool
def execute_query(query: str, config: RunnableConfig) -> list:
    """
    Executes a SQL query. Use this ONLY when you are absolutely certain your query is correct and ready.
    This tool will automatically limit results to 20 rows to prevent memory overflow.
    """
    db_name = config["configurable"].get("db_name")
    if not db_name:
        return "Error: Database name not provided."

    # --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
    # Automatically add a LIMIT clause to prevent huge outputs
    # The 're.IGNORECASE' flag handles 'limit', 'LIMIT', 'Limit', etc.
    if "limit" not in re.findall(r'\b(limit)\b', query, re.IGNORECASE):
        # Append LIMIT if the query is a SELECT statement
        if query.strip().lower().startswith("select"):
            print("---INFO: Query has no LIMIT clause. Adding 'LIMIT 20' to prevent overflow.---")
            query = f"{query.rstrip(';')} LIMIT 20;"

    return db_manager.query(query, db_name=db_name)
Solution 2: Manage Agent Memory (Long-Term Fix)
An agent shouldn't have infinite memory. A robust solution is to implement windowed memory, where the agent only considers the last k messages. This ensures that even very long conversations can continue indefinitely without overflowing the context window.

You can implement this with a simple change in your agent_node.

Corrected agent_node with Memory
Python

# The node that will call the LLM agent
def agent_node(state: MessagesState, config: ConfigSchema):
    """
    The "brain" of the agent. It calls the LLM to decide the next action.
    Now includes windowed memory.
    """
    # --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
    # Get the current list of messages
    messages = state['messages']

    # Keep only the last 10 messages to prevent context overflow.
    # The system prompt should always be included, so we keep the first message.
    if len(messages) > 10:
        print("---INFO: History is long. Pruning to the last 10 messages.---")
        messages_to_send = [messages[0]] + messages[-9:]
    else:
        messages_to_send = messages

    # NOTE: 'llm' must be defined in your scope and bound to the tools
    # e.g., llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o").bind_tools(tools)
    response = llm.invoke(messages_to_send, config)
    return {"messages": [response]}
Recommendation
You should implement both solutions.

Safer tools prevent a single bad query from crashing the agent immediately.
Memory management ensures the agent remains stable and functional over long, multi-step tasks.

how can i show that graph ?




Show thinking
Of course. Visualizing the graph is an excellent way to understand and debug your agent's logic. LangGraph provides several built-in methods to render the structure you've created.

You can add the following code right after you compile the graph with react_graph = react_builder.compile().

1. ASCII Art (Simple & Universal)
This is the quickest way to see the structure directly in your terminal, and it requires no extra libraries.

Python

print("--- Visualizing The Agent Graph ---")

# Draw the graph in the console using ASCII art
ascii_art = react_graph.get_graph().draw_ascii()
print(ascii_art)
This will output:

+-------+
| agent |
+-------+
    *
    *
    *
+-------+       +-------+
| tools |------>| agent |
+-------+       +-------+
2. Mermaid Diagram (Recommended for Notebooks)
This generates syntax for a Mermaid.js diagram, which renders beautifully in environments like Jupyter Notebooks, Notion, or GitHub markdown.

Python

from IPython.display import Image, Markdown

# Generate the Mermaid syntax
mermaid_syntax = react_graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid()
print("\n--- Mermaid Syntax for Rendering ---")
print(mermaid_syntax)


# To display the diagram directly in a Jupyter Notebook, you would run:
# display(Markdown(mermaid_syntax))
This will output the syntax:

Code snippet

graph TD
   agent --> tools;
   tools --> agent;
   agent --> __end__;
   __start__ --> agent;
When rendered, it looks like this:

Code snippet

graph TD
   agent --> tools;
   tools --> agent;
   agent --> __end__;
   __start__ --> agent;
3. PNG Image File (High Quality)
You can also save the graph as a PNG image file.

Note: This method requires you to have pygraphviz and graphviz installed.

Installation:
pip install pygraphviz
You may also need to install the Graphviz system library (e.g., sudo apt-get install graphviz on Debian/Ubuntu or brew install graphviz on macOS).
Python

# --- To save as a PNG image file ---
try:
    png_data = react_graph.get_graph().draw_png()
    with open("react_agent_graph.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(png_data)
    print("\n--- PNG image of the graph saved to react_agent_graph.png ---")
    
    # To display the diagram directly in a Jupyter Notebook, you would run:
    # from IPython.display import Image
    # display(Image(png_data))

except Exception as e:
    print(f"\nCould not generate PNG. Please ensure graphviz and pygraphviz are installed. Error: {e}")

Performance Evaluation of a ReAct-based Text-to-SQL Agent
Abstract—This document presents the performance evaluation of a custom-built ReAct (Reason-Act) agent developed using the LangGraph framework for Text-to-SQL tasks. The agent was tested against a benchmark dataset of 18 questions categorized by difficulty. The primary metric for evaluation was execution accuracy, which measures whether the agent's final generated SQL query produces the correct result when executed against the database. The agent demonstrated high overall proficiency, achieving an accuracy of 83.33%, with notable variations in performance across different complexity levels.

I. METHODOLOGY
The agent employs a step-by-step reasoning process to incrementally solve database queries. The core architecture is a stateful graph where the agent iteratively uses a defined set of tools to explore the database schema before generating a final query.

The toolset provided to the agent includes:

list_tables: To discover available tables.
get_comprehensive_table_info: To retrieve schema, sample data, and foreign key information for specific tables.
execute_query: To execute the final SQL query and retrieve the answer.
The evaluation was conducted on a benchmark dataset comprising 18 questions. The dataset was evenly distributed into three difficulty categories: Simple (typically involving single-table lookups), Moderate (requiring joins and aggregations), and Challenging (involving complex joins, subqueries, or nuanced logic).

II. RESULTS
The agent's performance was measured across the three difficulty categories. A summary of the execution accuracy is presented in TABLE I.

TABLE I: AGENT ACCURACY BY QUERY DIFFICULTY

Category	Simple	Moderate	Challenging	Overall
Question Count	6	6	6	18
Accuracy (%)	66.67%	100.00%	83.33%	83.33%

Export to Sheets
The agent achieved an overall execution accuracy of 83.33%. Performance on Moderate queries was perfect at 100.00%, and performance on Challenging queries was also strong at 83.33%. The lowest performance was observed on Simple queries, with an accuracy of 66.67%.

III. DISCUSSION
The evaluation highlights several key characteristics of the ReAct agent's behavior.

A. Effectiveness on Complex Queries
The perfect accuracy on moderate queries and high accuracy on challenging ones indicate that the agent's methodology is exceptionally well-suited for complex problems. The iterative process of listing tables, inspecting schemas, and forming hypotheses allows the agent to reliably construct correct queries involving multiple joins and conditions. This demonstrates the value of tool-based schema exploration over attempting to generate a query in a single pass.

B. Anomaly in Simple Query Performance
The lower accuracy of 66.67% on simple queries presents an interesting anomaly. A potential hypothesis is that the agent is prone to "over-thinking" simple problems. Its reasoning process, optimized for discovering complex relationships, may lead it to perform unnecessary table explorations or self-correct in ways that introduce errors into otherwise straightforward queries.

C. Qualitative Observations
Analysis of the execution logs reveals the agent's systematic approach. For most queries, it correctly identifies the necessary tables and constructs a logical plan. However, the logs also show instances of non-optimal behavior. For example, in the second query run (Indicate which atoms are connected...), the agent entered a repetitive loop, executing the same correct query multiple times (Steps 10-15) before finalizing its thought process. This indicates a potential area for improvement in the agent's state management and termination logic.

IV. CONCLUSION
The implemented ReAct agent is a robust and effective solution for complex Text-to-SQL tasks, achieving a high overall accuracy of 83.33%. Its core strength lies in its methodical, tool-based exploration of the database schema, which allows it to handle complex joins and logic successfully.

Future work should focus on two key areas:

Improving Simple Query Accuracy: Investigating why the agent falters on simple tasks and potentially implementing a router or logic to bypass deep exploration for straightforward questions.
Refining Agent Reasoning Loops: Enhancing the agent's ability to recognize when a task is complete to prevent redundant actions and non-productive loops.

Of course. This log shows the performance of a different, non-iterative graph architecture. Here is a formal analysis of these new results, suitable for a report.

Performance Evaluation of a Modular, Non-Iterative Text-to-SQL Graph
Abstract—This report details the performance of a modular Text-to-SQL generation pipeline. The system operates in a single pass without iterative refinement. It first analyzes the user's question to determine its complexity, then selectively prunes the database schema for non-simple queries, and finally generates a SQL query. The graph's performance was evaluated against a benchmark of 18 questions, demonstrating an overall execution accuracy of 61.11%. While effective on moderately complex queries, the architecture showed significant limitations, particularly with simple and challenging queries, when compared to an iterative, agent-based approach.

I. METHODOLOGY
The system is implemented as a directed acyclic graph in LangGraph with three primary stages:

Analyzer Node: Classifies the input question as 'simple', 'moderate', or 'challenging'.
Schema Path Extractor Node: This node is activated for 'moderate' and 'challenging' questions. It identifies and extracts a subset of the most relevant tables and columns from the full schema. This serves as a schema pruning step to reduce the context for the final generation.
Query Generator Node: This final node synthesizes the SQL query. It uses the full database schema for 'simple' questions and the pruned schema path for more complex ones.
The graph's architecture is strictly feed-forward; it does not loop or self-correct based on execution outcomes. The evaluation was performed on the same benchmark of 18 questions used previously, measuring execution accuracy.

II. RESULTS
The quantitative results of the evaluation are summarized in TABLE II. The graph was tasked with generating SQL queries for a dataset evenly distributed across three difficulty tiers.

TABLE II: MODULAR GRAPH ACCURACY BY QUERY DIFFICULTY

Category	Simple	Moderate	Challenging	Overall
Question Count	6	6	6	18
Accuracy (%)	33.33%	83.33%	66.67%	61.11%

Export to Sheets
The system achieved an overall accuracy of 61.11%. The highest performance was on Moderate queries at 83.33%. Performance on Challenging queries was 66.67%, while Simple queries had the lowest success rate at 33.33%.

III. DISCUSSION
A. Comparative Performance
The overall accuracy of 61.11% is a significant decrease from the 83.33% achieved by the previously evaluated iterative ReAct agent. This suggests that while the modular pipeline has some merit, the lack of iterative refinement is a critical disadvantage.

B. Analysis of Strengths
The system's strong performance on moderate queries (83.33%) indicates that the schema-pruning strategy is effective. By identifying a relevant schema path, the graph reduces the complexity and noise for the final query generation step, leading to a high success rate for queries that require straightforward joins and filtering.

C. Analysis of Weaknesses
The primary weakness of this architecture is its "one-shot" nature. It formulates a plan (the schema path) and generates a query once. If any part of this process is flawed, there is no mechanism for recovery.

Challenging Queries: For challenging queries, the initial schema path selection may be imperfect, leading the generator to construct a syntactically valid but semantically incorrect query. For example, in the log for the question Calculate the total average cost that Elijah Allen spent..., the generated UNION query is syntactically plausible but functionally incorrect for the question. The ReAct agent, by contrast, could have executed a simpler query first and refined its approach.
Simple Queries: The extremely low accuracy on simple queries (33.33%) suggests that the model struggles to generate correct queries even when given the full schema, or that the difficulty classification itself may be flawed. Without the ability to test and self-correct, these initial errors are final.
IV. CONCLUSION
The modular, non-iterative graph represents a structured and logical approach to Text-to-SQL. Its schema-pruning capability is a valuable technique for focusing the language model on relevant parts of the database. However, its overall performance is fundamentally limited by its inability to iteratively refine its work or recover from errors.

The results strongly indicate that for complex, multi-step reasoning tasks like Text-to-SQL, an iterative and interactive architecture (such as the ReAct agent) that can test its hypotheses and correct its mistakes yields significantly more accurate and reliable results.
