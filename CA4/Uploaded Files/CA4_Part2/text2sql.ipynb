    "## Text-to-SQL: Converting Natural Language to Database Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Text-to-SQL is a critical task in natural language processing that involves translating natural language questions into executable SQL queries. This is particularly important for making databases accessible to non-technical users through conversational interfaces, chatbots, and data analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will progressively build and evaluate multiple Text-to-SQL pipelines, each demonstrating different levels of sophistication and reasoning capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline Approach**: Simple prompting with a single LLM call\n",
    "2. **Chain/Router System**: Difficulty-based routing with schema reasoning\n",
    "3. **ReAct Agent**: Tool-based exploration with iterative refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the fundamental challenges in Text-to-SQL conversion\n",
    "- Learn different prompting strategies for complex reasoning tasks\n",
    "- Implement graph-based workflows using LangGraph\n",
    "- Build autonomous agents that can explore database schemas\n",
    "- Evaluate and compare different AI approaches quantitatively\n",
    "- Analyze limitations and potential improvements for each method\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic understanding of SQL and database concepts\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "- Knowledge of large language models and prompting\n",
    "- Understanding of LangChain and LangGraph frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a benchmark dataset of 18 questions covering various difficulty levels:\n",
    "- **Simple**: Single-table queries with basic operations\n",
    "- **Moderate**: Multi-table joins and aggregations\n",
    "- **Challenging**: Complex subqueries and advanced SQL constructs\n",
    "\n",
    "Each question comes with its corresponding database schema, allowing us to evaluate how well different approaches can leverage structural information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate our approaches using **Execution Accuracy**:\n",
    "- Generate SQL query from natural language question\n",
    "- Execute query against the actual database\n",
    "- Compare results with ground truth answers\n",
    "- Accuracy = (correct executions) / (total questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a realistic assessment of practical utility, as syntactically correct but semantically incorrect queries will be caught.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin our journey from simple prompting to advanced agent-based systems!"

    "\n",
    "#### **1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chain/Router model is a powerful architectural pattern used to create advanced, multi-skilled AI systems. Instead of relying on a single, monolithic model to handle all tasks, this architecture directs user requests to different, specialized processing workflows (\"Chains\") based on the nature of the request. The \"Router\" acts as an intelligent switchboard, ensuring that each query is handled by the most appropriate tool for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach leads to significantly higher accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, as it allows the system to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Core Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2.1. The \"Chain\": A Specialized Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Chain** is a sequence of pre-defined steps designed to accomplish a specific, narrow task. Each step's output serves as the input for the next. In the context of a Text-to-SQL application, you might have several distinct chains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple SQL Chain:** Optimized with a prompt that excels at generating basic, single-table queries.\n",
    "* **Complex SQL Chain:** Uses a more detailed prompt, perhaps with a few-shot learning examples, to handle multi-table `JOIN`s, subqueries, and complex aggregations.\n",
    "* **Data Analysis Chain:** A chain that not only generates SQL but also executes it and summarizes the results in natural language.\n",
    "* **Error Correction Chain:** A chain that takes a faulty SQL query and attempts to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating specialized chains, each can be fine-tuned and optimized for its unique purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2.2. The \"Router\": An Intelligent Decision-Maker**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Router** is the entry point of the system. Its sole responsibility is to analyze the incoming user request and decide which specialized Chain is best suited to handle it. The routing logic itself is typically powered by an LLM call with a prompt focused on classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Text-to-SQL system, the router would make the following kind of decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** User Question\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Router Analysis (LLM Call):**\n",
    "    * *Is this a simple question about one table?* ->  Route to **Simple SQL Chain**.\n",
    "    * *Does this question require joining multiple tables?* ->  Route to **Complex SQL Chain**.\n",
    "    * *Is the user asking to fix a previous query?* -> Route to **Error Correction Chain**.\n",
    "    * *Is this just a greeting or off-topic chat?* -> Route to a separate **General Conversation Chain**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Implementing a Chain/Router architecture provides several key advantages over a single-prompt approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved Accuracy:** By routing tasks to specialized chains with tailored prompts and logic, the system is far more likely to produce a correct result. A prompt for a complex query doesn't have to be generic enough to also handle a simple one.\n",
    "* **Increased Efficiency:** Simple requests can be routed to faster, less expensive models, while only complex requests utilize more powerful (and costly) models.\n",
    "* **Enhanced Robustness:** The system can gracefully handle a wide variety of inputs. It avoids trying to generate SQL from a non-SQL-related question (e.g., \"Hello, how are you?\"), which improves the user experience.\n",
    "* **Modularity and Maintainability:** Each chain can be developed, tested, and improved independently. This makes the overall system easier to manage and scale over time. You can add new capabilities simply by creating a new chain and teaching the router about it."

    "This Python script defines a query_generator_node function designed to convert a natural language question into a SQL query. It intelligently constructs a detailed prompt for an AI model (LLM) using the database schema and, if available, a pre-identified \"schema path\" to focus the AI's attention on the most relevant tables. The function is built to take this information and produce a clean SQL query as its final output.\n",

    "### **Performance Evaluation of a Refined Modular Text-to-SQL Graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract—This report details the performance of a refined modular Text-to-SQL generation pipeline. The system operates in a single pass, first analyzing the user's question to determine its complexity, then leveraging a schema-pruning mechanism for non-simple queries before generating the final SQL command. The graph's performance was evaluated against a benchmark of 18 questions, demonstrating a high overall execution accuracy of 88.89%. The results indicate that this single-pass, \"plan-and-execute\" architecture, when properly tuned, can achieve state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing more complex iterative agentic frameworks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **I. METHODOLOGY**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is implemented as a directed acyclic graph in LangGraph with three primary stages:\n",
    "1.  **Analyzer Node:** Classifies the input question as 'simple', 'moderate', or 'challenging'.\n",
    "2.  **Schema Path Extractor Node:** This node is activated for 'moderate' and 'challenging' questions. It identifies and extracts a subset of the most relevant tables and columns from the full schema. This serves as a schema-pruning step to reduce the context for the final generation.\n",
    "3.  **Query Generator Node:** This final node synthesizes the SQL query. It uses the full database schema for 'simple' questions and the pruned schema path for more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph's architecture is strictly feed-forward; it does not loop or self-correct. The evaluation was performed on a benchmark of 18 questions, measuring execution accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **II. RESULTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantitative results of the evaluation are summarized in TABLE III. The graph demonstrated exceptional performance, particularly on complex query types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TABLE III: REFINED MODULAR GRAPH ACCURACY BY QUERY DIFFICULTY**\n",
    "| Category | Simple | Moderate | Challenging | **Overall** |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Question Count** | 6 | 6 | 6 | **18** |\n",
    "| **Accuracy (%)** | 66.67% | 100.00% | 100.00% | **88.89%** |\n",
    "\n",
    "The system achieved an outstanding **overall accuracy of 88.89%**. Performance on both **Moderate** and **Challenging** queries was perfect at **100.00%**, a testament to the system's ability to handle complex logic and joins. Performance on **Simple** queries was 66.67%.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **III. DISCUSSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Performance Analysis**\n",
    "An overall accuracy of 88.89% establishes this non-iterative architecture as a highly effective solution. The perfect scores in the moderate and challenging categories are particularly noteworthy. This result suggests that the pre-computation of a relevant \"schema path\" provides the language model with a sufficiently focused context to generate correct, complex queries in a single attempt, negating the need for iterative refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. The Power of Schema Pruning**\n",
    "The core strength of this architecture lies in the synergy between the `Analyzer` and `Schema Path Extractor` nodes. By correctly identifying complex questions and then providing the `Query Generator` with only the essential tables and columns, the system effectively reduces the problem space. This \"plan-and-execute\" model proves to be not only efficient but also remarkably accurate, challenging the assumption that iterative, conversational agents are always superior for complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Analysis of Simple Queries**\n",
    "The remaining area for improvement is the performance on simple queries (66.67%). The logs indicate an inconsistency in routing for questions classified as 'simple'; some are correctly routed directly to the query generator, while others are unnecessarily sent through the schema path extractor. This inconsistent routing is the likely cause for the lower accuracy in this category. Refining the conditional edge logic to ensure all 'simple' queries bypass the schema extraction step would likely elevate the overall accuracy further.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **IV. CONCLUSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The refined modular, non-iterative graph has proven to be a highly successful and efficient architecture for Text-to-SQL. Its ability to achieve 100% accuracy on both moderate and challenging queries demonstrates the power of intelligent schema pruning as a substitute for iterative correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results indicate that for well-defined tasks, a single-pass pipeline that effectively plans its context can match or even exceed the performance of more complex ReAct agents. Future optimization should focus on perfecting the initial routing mechanism for simple queries to achieve exceptional accuracy across all difficulty levels."

    "### Performance Evaluation of a ReAct-based Text-to-SQL Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract—This document presents the performance evaluation of a custom-built ReAct (Reason-Act) agent developed using the LangGraph framework for Text-to-SQL tasks. The agent was tested against a benchmark dataset of 18 questions categorized by difficulty. The primary metric for evaluation was execution accuracy, which measures whether the agent's final generated SQL query produces the correct result when executed against the database. The agent demonstrated high overall proficiency, achieving an accuracy of 83.33%, with notable variations in performance across different complexity levels.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I. METHODOLOGY\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent employs a step-by-step reasoning process to incrementally solve database queries. The core architecture is a stateful graph where the agent iteratively uses a defined set of tools to explore the database schema before generating a final query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The toolset provided to the agent includes:\n",
    "* `list_tables`: To discover available tables.\n",
    "* `get_comprehensive_table_info`: To retrieve schema, sample data, and foreign key information for specific tables.\n",
    "* `execute_query`: To execute the final SQL query and retrieve the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation was conducted on a benchmark dataset comprising 18 questions. The dataset was evenly distributed into three difficulty categories: **Simple** (typically involving single-table lookups), **Moderate** (requiring joins and aggregations), and **Challenging** (involving complex joins, subqueries, or nuanced logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### II. RESULTS\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent's performance was measured across the three difficulty categories. A summary of the execution accuracy is presented in TABLE I.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TABLE I: AGENT ACCURACY BY QUERY DIFFICULTY**\n",
    "| Category | Simple | Moderate | Challenging | **Overall** |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Question Count** | 6 | 6 | 6 | **18** |\n",
    "| **Accuracy (%)** | 66.67% | 100.00% | 83.33% | **83.33%** |\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent achieved an overall execution accuracy of **83.33%**. Performance on **Moderate** queries was perfect at **100.00%**, and performance on **Challenging** queries was also strong at **83.33%**. The lowest performance was observed on **Simple** queries, with an accuracy of **66.67%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### III. DISCUSSION\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation highlights several key characteristics of the ReAct agent's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Effectiveness on Complex Queries**\n",
    "The perfect accuracy on moderate queries and high accuracy on challenging ones indicate that the agent's methodology is exceptionally well-suited for complex problems. The iterative process of listing tables, inspecting schemas, and forming hypotheses allows the agent to reliably construct correct queries involving multiple joins and conditions. This demonstrates the value of tool-based schema exploration over attempting to generate a query in a single pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Anomaly in Simple Query Performance**\n",
    "The lower accuracy of 66.67% on simple queries presents an interesting anomaly. A potential hypothesis is that the agent is prone to \"over-thinking\" simple problems. Its reasoning process, optimized for discovering complex relationships, may lead it to perform unnecessary table explorations or self-correct in ways that introduce errors into otherwise straightforward queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Qualitative Observations**\n",
    "Analysis of the execution logs reveals the agent's systematic approach. For most queries, it correctly identifies the necessary tables and constructs a logical plan. However, the logs also show instances of non-optimal behavior. For example, in the second query run (`Indicate which atoms are connected...`), the agent entered a repetitive loop, executing the same correct query multiple times (Steps 10-15) before finalizing its thought process. This indicates a potential area for improvement in the agent's state management and termination logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IV. CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented ReAct agent is a robust and effective solution for complex Text-to-SQL tasks, achieving a high overall accuracy of 83.33%. Its core strength lies in its methodical, tool-based exploration of the database schema, which allows it to handle complex joins and logic successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work should focus on two key areas:\n",
    "1.  **Improving Simple Query Accuracy:** Investigating why the agent falters on simple tasks and potentially implementing a router or logic to bypass deep exploration for straightforward questions.\n",
    "2.  **Refining Agent Reasoning Loops:** Enhancing the agent's ability to recognize when a task is complete to prevent redundant actions and non-productive loops."
