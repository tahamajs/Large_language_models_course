        "### **What is In-Context Learning?**\n",
        "In-Context Learning (ICL) refers to the ability of a (usually large) language model to perform a new task simply by being prompted with examples of that task—without any further fine-tuning or gradient-based updates to its parameters. Instead of modifying the model weights, we provide a “context” in the input prompt that illustrates how to handle certain inputs and produce corresponding outputs. Once the model sees a few examples (a “few-shot prompt”) demonstrating the task, it can then attempt that same task on a new input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concretely, you provide a small number of examples (e.g., question-answer pairs or input-output pairs) in the model’s prompt, followed by a new query for which you want the answer. The model effectively “learns” (in a lightweight sense) how to do the task by mimicking the patterns from the examples in context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How does it differ from fine-tuning?**\n",
        "- **Parameter updates**:\n",
        "  - **ICL**: The model’s parameters remain **unchanged**. All “learning” happens through the temporary context given to the model.  \n",
        "  - **Fine-tuning**: Involves **updating the weights** of the model itself using a labeled training dataset. Once updated, these new model weights are used for inference.  \n",
        "- **Amount of data**:\n",
        "  - **ICL**: Usually requires only a few examples in the prompt (few-shot).  \n",
        "  - **Fine-tuning**: Typically requires a larger, dedicated training set—though there exist low-data fine-tuning methods, it is still more data-driven than ICL.  \n",
        "- **Flexibility**:\n",
        "  - **ICL**: Highly flexible—one large model can attempt many different tasks by simply changing the prompt.  \n",
        "  - **Fine-tuning**: Once a model is fine-tuned for a specific task (or distribution of tasks), it becomes specialized to that task. Switching tasks requires a new fine-tuning or a specially designed multi-task fine-tuning approach.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **What are its limitations compared to fine-tuning?**\n",
        "1. **Prompt Sensitivity**:  \n",
        "   ICL is often sensitive to the exact format and ordering of the examples in the prompt. Small differences—like rearranging examples or rephrasing instructions—can alter performance noticeably.  \n",
        "2. **Context Length Constraints**:  \n",
        "   Large language models have a limited prompt window. If you need to show many examples or have very large contexts, you may exceed the model’s maximum input length.  \n",
        "3. **No Long-Term Updating**:  \n",
        "   Because no parameters are changed, the model does not “retain” any new knowledge across queries. It “forgets” whatever was in the previous prompt as soon as you move on to a different prompt.  \n",
        "4. **Potentially Worse Performance on Complex Tasks**:  \n",
        "   For complex tasks or tasks requiring a lot of domain knowledge, few examples in the prompt may not be enough. Fine-tuning can often systematically and robustly improve performance by updating the model on a larger, domain-specific dataset.  \n",
        "5. **Cost and Computational Load**:  \n",
        "   For very large models, the cost of passing long prompts every time can be high. Fine-tuning (once done) may be more efficient at inference time for repeated usage in a specific domain.  \n",

        "### **What is Chain-of-Thought Prompting?**\n",
        "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a prompting strategy in which, rather than providing only the final answer in each few-shot exemplar, you also provide the **intermediate reasoning steps** that lead from the question to the final answer. These intermediate steps are written in natural language as part of the prompt. During inference on a new query, the model is encouraged to generate a similar chain of reasoning (“chain of thought”) before arriving at its answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, instead of giving a math word problem and directly providing “Answer: 11,” the prompt might look like:\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Question**: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?  \n",
        "> **Chain of Thought**: Roger started with 5 tennis balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11.  \n",
        "> **Answer**: 11  \n",
        "\n",
        "When the model sees multiple exemplars that show a step-by-step solution in natural language, it begins to emulate that process on new test questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How does it work and why does it help?**\n",
        "1. **Decomposition of Complex Tasks**  \n",
        "   By **showing** the model how to break down a multi-step reasoning problem into smaller natural-language steps, CoT prompting helps it avoid skipping directly to a (possibly incorrect) guess. Instead, it emulates a more deliberative process—if the chain of reasoning is correct, it often arrives at the correct final answer.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Utilizing Latent Knowledge**  \n",
        "   Large language models have absorbed massive amounts of textual data. Writing out a chain of thought can activate the relevant pieces of knowledge or “subroutines” the model has learned but might not spontaneously use if it were only prompted for a final answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interpretability**  \n",
        "   Because the model is prompted to produce intermediate steps, the chain of thought can serve as a window into the model’s reasoning. Although it is not a guarantee that these steps perfectly mirror the internal computations, it still provides a more interpretable output than a single end result.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Improved Accuracy**  \n",
        "   Empirically, research (including the *Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models* paper) has shown that sufficiently large models (on the order of 100B+ parameters) see dramatic improvements on tasks like math word problems, commonsense QA, and symbolic reasoning when using CoT prompting.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Limitations of Chain-of-Thought Prompting**\n",
        "1. **Model Scale Dependence**:  \n",
        "   CoT prompting tends to become significantly effective only at large scale (hundreds of billions of parameters). Smaller models often produce chains of thought that are fluent but logically incorrect or incoherent, which can degrade performance.  \n",
        "2. **No Guarantee of Correct Steps**:  \n",
        "   The model might produce incorrect or hallucinated reasoning steps, occasionally even if the final answer is correct. Conversely, it could produce a logically sound chain of thought but still land on the wrong final answer.  \n",
        "3. **Prompt Length Overhead**:  \n",
        "   CoT requires extra tokens in the prompt (i.e., the step-by-step reasoning), which can be costly in terms of model context window and runtime.  \n",
        "4. **Annotation / Creation of Exemplars**:  \n",
        "   Writing out high-quality chain-of-thought exemplars for few-shot prompts can be more labor-intensive than simply writing question-answer exemplars.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these limitations, CoT prompting reveals that large language models can often “explain” or at least **simulate** explanations of how they get from an input to an answer—and that ability corresponds to significantly improved performance on a wide range of tasks.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **(a)** *In-Context Learning* uses example prompts (few-shot learning) to guide a model’s behavior **without** updating its underlying weights. Compared to fine-tuning, it is more flexible across different tasks but can be more sensitive to prompt variations, is limited by context window constraints, and does not retain new knowledge.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **(b)** *Chain-of-Thought Prompting* augments each example in the prompt with the intermediate reasoning steps. Especially in large models, this has been shown to markedly improve performance on tasks requiring multi-step or logical reasoning (like math word problems, commonsense questions, or symbolic tasks). It does introduce additional length and complexity in prompting, but it often yields better accuracy and provides more interpretable outputs."

Each question is written in natural language and requires multi-step reasoning, such as simple algebra, arithmetic operations, or logical deduction. The dataset was created with a strong emphasis on clarity, consistency, and linguistic diversity, making it an effective testbed for evaluating models’ reasoning and problem-solving skills.\n",

The `answer` field contains the full step-by-step solution followed by the final numeric result, making it useful not only for answer generation but also for approaches like Chain-of-Thought prompting. GSM8K is frequently used in research on prompting methods and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for assessing how well they can break down and solve complex tasks without fine-tuning."

            "Answer: There are two quantities given in the problem: Trace’s five shopping bags and Gordon’s two shopping bags. The problem is asking for the weight of one of Trace’s bags. To find this, we must first determine the total weight of Gordon’s bags. Since one of Gordon’s bags weighs three pounds and the other weighs seven pounds, we can find the total weight by adding these two weights together: 3 + 7 = 10 pounds. Since Trace’s bags weigh the same amount as Gordon’s bags, we know that Trace’s bags also weigh a total of 10 pounds. Since there are five bags, we can find the weight of one bag by dividing the total weight by the number of bags: 10 pounds / 5 bags\n",

To average the times, I added the times for each player and divided by the number of players. The sum of the times is 130 + 145 + 85 + 60 + 180 = 600 seconds. The number of players is 5. Therefore, the average is 600 / 5 = 120 seconds. Converting 120 seconds to minutes, I multiplied by 1 minute = 60 seconds, so 120 seconds = 2 minutes.

We know that she made $50 total and that she made $11 from small and $24 from medium lemonades. So, the total amount of money she made from small and medium lemonades is $11 + $24 = $35. Since she made $50 total, she must have made $50 - $35 = $15 from large lemonades.

Since he has a total of 301 models, he has x + 4x + 16x = 21x models.  Since he has 301 models, we have 21x = 301.  Dividing both sides by 21 gives x = 14.

Since both loans will be paid over 20 years, we can use the formula for monthly payments, which is: M = P [ i(1+i)^n ] / [ (1+i)^n – 1], where M is the monthly payment, P is the principal amount, i is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments. However, since we don't have the interest rate, we'll assume a fixed interest rate for simplicity. Let's assume an annual interest rate of 5% and a\n",

            "Explanation: Initially, Eric sorted 150 colored pencils into 5 containers. Another teacher brought him 30 more pencils. Now Eric has 150 + 30 = 180 pencils. Eric wants to distribute the pencils evenly between the 5 containers. Since he cannot distribute 180 pencils evenly between 5 containers, we must determine the largest number of pencils he can distribute evenly between 5 containers. Since 180 is not evenly divisible by 5, we need to find the largest number that is less than 180 and is evenly divisible by 5. We can do this by finding the largest multiple of 5 that is less than 180. We can do this by finding the largest multiple of 5\n",

The next 100 channels cost $50.  So, the total cost is $100 + $50 = $150.  He splits this evenly with his roommate, so he pays $150 / 2 = $75.  The answer is $75.

        "The function `extract_answer(output_text)` is looking through a string (the `output_text`) for **any numeric values** and then returning **the last numeric value** it finds. Here’s how it works in detail:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Regular expression**:  \n",
        "   It uses `re.findall(r\"[-+]?\\d*\\.\\d+|\\d+\", output_text)`. This pattern matches the following:\n",
        "   - `[-+]?` optionally matches a **plus** (`+`) or **minus** (`-`) sign.  \n",
        "   - `\\d*\\.\\d+` matches **floating-point** numbers, i.e., zero or more digits `\\d*` followed by a decimal point `\\.`, followed by one or more digits `\\d+`.\n",
        "   - `|\\d+` is an **OR** branch that matches **integer** values (`\\d+`), i.e., one or more digits.  \n",
        "\n",
        "   Putting it all together, the pattern finds:\n",
        "   - Positive or negative decimal numbers (e.g., `+3.14`, `-0.01`, `3.14159`)  \n",
        "   - Positive or negative integers (e.g., `+10`, `-5`, `42`)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Retrieving matches**:\n",
        "   - The call to `re.findall(...)` returns **all** substrings in `output_text` that match the pattern.  \n",
        "   - These matches are stored in a list, `matches`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Returning the last match**:\n",
        "   - `return matches[-1] if matches else None` returns the **last** element in the `matches` list if the list is not empty.\n",
        "   - If `matches` is empty (meaning no numeric pattern was found), it returns `None`.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Why return the last match?**  \n",
        "Often in “chain-of-thought” or step-by-step solutions, a text may contain **multiple numbers**, and the code wants the “final numeric answer,” which is typically the last number mentioned. Hence, returning the final match is a quick heuristic for retrieving that concluding answer."

However, human preferences often span **several dimensions** (e.g., helpfulness, safety, honesty, politeness). Compressing them into a **single** number can lose critical information.\n",

Both might map to a similar single reward, making it unclear which dimension the model should prioritize.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Multi-Dimensional Reward Vector**  \n",
        "   - **Reward Model Architecture**: Instead of a single output head (like Bradley-Terry’s scalar), the reward model has multiple heads, each corresponding to a specific dimension (e.g., helpfulness head, safety head, correctness head).  \n",
        "   - **Training**: You collect preference data or labeled data for each dimension. For instance, you might have separate labels for how “helpful” a response is vs. how “safe” it is. The model then learns to predict each dimension’s score.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Aggregating Objectives**  \n",
        "   - **Weighted Combination**: At policy training time (e.g., RL or direct optimization), you can combine these dimension-specific scores with **weights** that reflect your priorities. For instance, you might set a higher weight on safety if that is non-negotiable.  \n",
        "   - **Constraint-Based**: Alternatively, you can treat certain dimensions (like safety) as a **hard constraint** that must exceed a threshold, while optimizing others (like helpfulness) more freely.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Benefits**  \n",
        "   - **Explicit Trade-Offs**: You can tune how much to prioritize each dimension. If you see the policy being too “safe” at the expense of helpfulness, you adjust the weights or constraints.  \n",
        "   - **Interpretability**: You get more insight into *why* a model’s response is considered high- or low-quality—because you can see separate scores for each dimension.  \n",
        "   - **Mitigating Biases & “Reward Hacking”**: By monitoring multiple signals, you reduce the chance of the model exploiting one dimension at the expense of others. For example, if the model tries to produce very long answers (to appear “helpful”), it might get penalized on a “relevance” or “conciseness” dimension.\n",

Rather than allowing large, unconstrained steps in the policy parameters, PPO imposes a **clipped objective** that restricts how far the new policy can deviate from the old policy. This clipping prevents destructive updates that could degrade performance or destabilize training.\n",

        "In **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, a reward model is trained (or reused) to encode human preferences for the agent’s outputs. The policy (in this context, typically a language model) interacts with the environment by generating text, receives a reward from the reward model, and then updates its parameters to maximize this reward. PPO’s **role** is to ensure that each update is sufficiently large to incorporate the new feedback signal yet **not so large** that the policy drifts drastically from previously successful behaviors. As a result, PPO helps maintain **training stability** and **consistent performance** while aligning the model’s outputs with human preferences.\n",

This designation implies that the data (state–action pairs and rewards) used to update the policy must be generated by **the same policy** currently being trained.

If experiences were gathered from an older or different policy (off-policy), there would be a **distribution mismatch** between the data used to compute gradients and the policy being updated. This mismatch can lead to **suboptimal or unstable** learning. By maintaining an on-policy approach, PPO ensures that the collected data accurately reflects the current policy’s behavior, thereby producing more reliable gradient estimates and promoting better alignment of the model with human-defined preferences.\n"

        "\n",
        "1. **Pairwise Comparisons**: For an input $z$, we have two candidate outputs: a “preferred” sample $y^+$ and a “dispreferred” sample $y^-$. These come from human annotations or a preference dataset.  \n",

By **increasing** $\\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{net}}}(y^+|z)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{net}}}(y^-|z)}$, the model learns to favor outputs that humans prefer.  \n",
        "3. **No Separate Reward Model**: Unlike standard RLHF, which uses a reward model and a policy optimization step (e.g., PPO), DPO treats preference data as direct supervision on the **relative** probabilities of pairs $(y^+, y^-)$.  \n",

        "Overall, **DPO** can be viewed as a simpler, more direct approach to preference alignment than RLHF with PPO. Instead of iterating between a reward model and policy updates, DPO **directly** shifts the model distribution so that **preferred samples** become more likely.\n",

        "\n",
        "In methods such as **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** and **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**, a **reference model** (or “baseline” policy) often serves as a stability anchor, discouraging the newly updated policy from drifting too far from previously learned behaviors. **ORPO (Offline Relative Policy Optimization)** omits this reference model entirely. As a result, the **policy** being trained is directly optimized based on **pairwise preferences** or offline data without explicitly comparing its outputs to a fixed baseline. This design leads to simplifications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Fewer Components to Manage**  \n",
        "   - Eliminating the reference model means there is no need to maintain, load, or synchronize a separate checkpoint. This reduces engineering overhead and memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Direct Policy Updates**  \n",
        "   - Instead of bounding the new policy by a KL divergence to the old policy, ORPO directly optimizes the model’s parameters with respect to the preference data. This can simplify the objective function, removing extra hyperparameters or clipping terms needed to stabilize the comparison between two policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Less Dependency on Carefully Chosen Baselines**  \n",
        "   - In RLHF or DPO, picking or updating the reference model incorrectly can lead to suboptimal or unstable results. ORPO sidesteps this complexity by **not** anchoring updates to a baseline, relying instead on offline preference signals alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**(b) Advantages and Disadvantages Compared to RLHF and DPO**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Advantages**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Reduced Complexity**: Without maintaining a reference model, the training pipeline is simpler—fewer hyperparameters (like KL coefficients) and fewer moving parts (no separate baseline or “old policy”).\n",
        "   - **Potentially Faster Updates**: ORPO can more aggressively optimize for the preference data since it does not strictly constrain policy changes against a baseline. This may yield quicker adaptation if the offline data is representative.\n",
        "   - **Lower Resource Usage**: Not storing or continually synchronizing a reference model can save computational resources, which is especially valuable for large language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Disadvantages**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Risk of Overfitting**: Without a reference model acting as a stability anchor, the policy might overfit to the available preference data, losing generalization or reverting to degenerate text generation (e.g., repeating the same high-scoring patterns).\n",
        "   - **Less “Safety Net”**: Methods like RLHF typically rely on a KL term or clipped objective to prevent catastrophic changes. ORPO, lacking a reference model, must rely on alternative mechanisms (e.g., curated offline data, other forms of regularization) to ensure stable, gradual updates.\n",
        "   - **Sensitivity to Data Quality**: Because the policy is updated purely from offline preference data without a baseline, any biases or inaccuracies in the dataset may lead the model astray. In RLHF or DPO, the reference model can partially mitigate poor data by providing a fallback distribution.\n",
